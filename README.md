# Bulls-And-Cows-Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Bulls and Cows game, a classic code-breaking game where the player tries to guess a secret code. The game provides feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows," which indicate the number of correct digits in the correct place and correct digits in the wrong place, respectively.

## Features

- **Game Setup**: Allows configuration of the secret code length and range of digits.
- **Player Interaction**: Provides a user interface for making guesses and receiving feedback.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Calculates and displays the number of bulls and cows for each guess.

## Usage

1. **Game Initialization**: The game starts by generating a random secret code.
2. **Making a Guess**: The player inputs their guess, which is then compared to the secret code.
3. **Receiving Feedback**: The game displays the number of bulls and cows to guide the player towards the correct code.
